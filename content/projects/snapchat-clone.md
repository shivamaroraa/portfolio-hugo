## Overview
This project is a Snapchat clone built using modern web technologies, including React.js, Firebase, and Redux. 

## Technical Features

- **React.js**: The frontend of the application was developed using React.js, for building user interfaces. It provided a seamless and responsive user experience, enabling real-time interactions and updates.

- **Firebase**: The backend and authentication system relied on Firebase, a cloud-based platform that offered real-time database capabilities, user authentication, and hosting. This allowed for quick development.

- **Redux**: To manage the application's state effectively, Redux was implemented. It provided a centralized store for all the data, enabling smooth communication between different components and ensuring data consistency.

- **Real-Time Communication**: The application utilized Firebase's real-time database to enable instant photo sharing, similar to Snapchat's core functionality.

- **User Authentication**: Firebase's authentication system was integrated allowing users to access the application using their Google accounts.

- **Ephemeral Content**: Just like Snapchat, the shared photos and videos were designed to be ephemeral, disappearing after a set period.
